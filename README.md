| Game Name | Date Completed | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Devil May Cry 2 | Feb 5, 2025 | Pretty fun game, even though the story is all over the place. Took a second to get used to the controls :suspect: |
| Twisted Metal 4 | Dec 1, 2024 | Classic, had an awesome time. Love the music in this one. Beat the game using Pizza Boy :godmode: |
| Twisted Metal III | Nov 27, 2024 | Very fun but pretty tough game. The music is awesome. Finished a run with Roadkill, had to do some campy maneuvers in the end to beat Primeval :suspect: |
| Way of the Samurai | June 23, 2024 | Pretty hard game to get the mechanics down. Was able to finish it after a ton of unsuccessful attempts :hurtrealbad: |
